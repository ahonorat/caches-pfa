/!\ Warning : this tool and Maqao work only on x64 processors.

### COMPILATION ###

To compile, use:

cmake dir [-DTEST=ON] [-DDEBUG=ON] [-DOPT]
make
make doc (if you want to generate doxygen documentation)

We advise you to choose <dir> out of cassis directory. It may bother the bench.
TEST builds the unitary tests executable.
DEBUG compile with -g.
OPT compile with -O3.

### EXECUTION ###

To execute a code line in your build directory <dir>, use :

./bin/simulator -f architecture_file -t number_threads -r traces_directory

Warning : you must have generated traces before, thanks to the script in MAQAO/ directory.
Warning : be aware of the interweaving configuration (in manage_threads.lua). 

### SOFTWARE MAN ###

You can find man pages in cassis/documentation/man/ directory.

How to use the software:
man cassis/documentation/man/cassis.1

How to use the architecture description files:
