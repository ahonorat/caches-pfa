# Description

CasSiS, Cache Simulation Software. 
This software analyses a maqao generated trace to provide statistics towards cache performance (hits, misses, etc). The architecture can be generated from hwloc (with lstopo --of xml file.xml) and enhanced by our file format file.cassis.xml. 
You will find the software and the documentation in cassis/ directory. Some documents are available in docs/, but there are in french. A report describes the working more precisely, and explains how to modify the source code.
