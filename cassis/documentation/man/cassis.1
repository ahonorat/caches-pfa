.SH SYNOPSIS
cassis -f file.xml -t number_threads -r traces_dir [-w] [-v int] [-i number_instr1[:...]] [-b addr_begin:addr_end] [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
CasSiS, Cache Simulation Software. This software analyses a maqao generated trace to provide statistics towards cache performance. The architecture can be generated from hwloc (with lstopo --of xml file.xml) and enhanced by our file format file.cassis.xml.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
\fB\-f <file>
Select architecture file. The architecture can be a file generated from hwloc (xml) or a file created by the user (cassis.xml). See cassis-xml for more details.
.TP
\fB\-t <int>
Select the number of threads. The number of threads must be lower than the number of cores, because this software cannot deal with context changement.
.TP
\fB\-r <dir>
Specify the directory to open trace files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-i <int>
Track only specified instructions for stats. Can be used with -b.
.SH ""
	-i 1:3:42 Track only 3 instructions.
.TP
\fB\-b <long:long>
Track only the values between two addresses : -b 0x000000000000:0xffffffffffff for all values ; -b no_stack for values that are not in the stack. Can be used with -i.
.TP
\fB\-l <file>
Select the file for threads interweaving. (Default: "./threads.lua")
.TP
\fB\-v <int>
Select the verbose mode.
.SH ""
	-v 1: print basic statistics: misses, hits and writes-back
.SH ""
	-v 2: print statisctics about data evinctions
.SH ""
	-v 3: print more detailled statistics about misses
.SH ""
	-v 4: print broadcast statistics
.TP
\fB\-o
Print mode. Print only tracked values, not all instructions results.
.TP
\fB\-d
Debug mode. Useful for printing caches after each instruction.
.TP
\fB\-w
Ignore fatal warnings. However the program will probably not be able to play the trace.
.TP
